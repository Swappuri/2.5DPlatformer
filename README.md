This 2.5D game is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Three.js. Players control an animated character sourced from Mixamo. The "A" and "D" keys move the character left and right. The "W" key makes the character jump. Holding "SHIFT" allows the character to sprint. Clear instructions are shown inside the game. The maps use assets from Kenney. They include spikes, pitfalls, and obstacles that reset the character to the start. A checkpoint in the middle of the map lets players save their progress. At the end, players see their completion time and can choose to replay the game.
